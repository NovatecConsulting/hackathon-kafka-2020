= Novatec Kafka Hackathon (WIP)

== Overview

In our Kafka Hackathon we would like to learn how to use Apache Kafka and the Confluent Plattform, as well as for which use cases Apache Kafka is suitable.

Goals of our first Kafka Hackathon:

- Getting to know Apache Kafka and the Confluent Platform
- Getting to know how to use Kafka and the other Confluent libraries and tools during appplication development
- Getting in touch with Confluent Cloud

The following sections give a short introduction to

- <<Apache Kafka>> and its features
- <<Confluent Platform>> and the features contained in the <<cp-community, community edition>> and in the <<cp-enterprise, enterprise edition>>
- <<Confluent Cloud>>

=== Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is described as a https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#introduction[distributed streaming platform].
Besides publish and subscribe it inherently supports the storage of streams of records in a fault-tolerant an permanent way.
In addition it enables the processing of streams of records as they occur. These are the three key capabilities of Apache Kafka.
A more detailed overview about Apache Kafka can be found at our https://www.novatec-gmbh.de/en/blog/kafka-101-series-part-1-introduction-to-kafka/[Kafka 101 Blog Series by Duy Hieu Vo].

Apache Kafka itself is run as a cluster on one or more servers and consists of Kafka brokers and Zookeeper nodes.

It has three core APIs with which developers can use to interact with a Kafka cluster:

- The core Client API which consists of a https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#producerapi[Producer API] and https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#consumerapi[Consumer API], which allows an application to publish and subscribe streams of records.
- The https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams[Streams API] allows an application to effectively transform streams of record and therfore basically provides the processing capability of Apache Kafka. An overview about Streaming and the Streams API can be found in the https://www.novatec-gmbh.de/en/blog/kafka-101-series-part-2-stream-processing-and-kafka-streams-api/[second blog post of our Kafka 101 Series].
- The https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Connector API] allows building and running reusable producers or consumers that connect Kafka to existing applications or data systems.

In addition, Apache Kafka includes a tool called https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#basic_ops_mirror_maker[MirrorMaker] to copy streams of records from a source cluster into a target cluster. 
The https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/tools/MirrorMaker.scala[first version of MirrorMaker] was based on the plain client API. In Apache Kafka 2.4 https://github.com/apache/kafka/tree/trunk/connect/mirror[MirrorMaker 2.0] was published, which leverages the Connect framework.

Apache Kafka, including the three core APIs as well as MirrorMaker 1.0 and 2.0 is licensed under the _Apache License 2.0_ and can be found on https://github.com/apache/kafka[GitHub].

The Apache Kafka project itself includes API implementations for Java and partially for Scala:

- Client API: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.kafka/kafka-clients[Java]
- Streams API: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.kafka/kafka-streams[Java], https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.kafka/kafka-streams-scala[Scala]
- Connect API: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.kafka/connect-api[Java]

The Kafka protocol is not standardized, but because it is open source, there are a lot of implementations for other languages.
However, because it is a lot of work to implement the protocol, most of the implementations are based on _librdkafka_. 
It is a C library implementation of the Apache Kafka protocol, providing Producer, Consumer and Admin client. _librdkafka_ can be found on https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka[GitHub] and is licensed under the _2-clause BSD license_.

==== Download and Usage

The current version of Apache Kafka is 2.4.0 and can be downloaded at https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/kafka/2.4.0/kafka_2.12-2.4.0.tgz.
If you would like to manually set up Kafka with this package, https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart is a good starting point.
The Apache Kafka documentation can be found at https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/.

=== Confluent Platform

Apache Kafka has been developed and built by the LinkedIn engineering team in order to serve as a central data hub that helps the companyâ€™s applications work together in a loosely coupled manner.
If you would like to know more about the origin of Apache Kafka you should read the the https://www.confluent.io/blog/event-streaming-platform-1/[blog post about building an event streaming platform by Jay Kreps, the CEO of Confluent]. You may also read https://engineering.linkedin.com/architecture/brief-history-scaling-linkedin[A Brief History of Scaling LinkedIn] which briefly describes the architectural changes at LinkedIn over time. 

Some of the developers of Apache Kafke departed LinkedIn and founded Confluent, a company focused on Kafka [see https://engineering.linkedin.com/kafka/kafka-linkedin-current-and-future]. Today Confluent is still the main contributer to the Apache Kafka project. However, there is also a growing community which also contributes to Apache Kafka.

Confluent offers the https://docs.confluent.io/5.3.2/platform.html[Confluent Platform], which on its core is based on the open source Apache Kafka. On top of that, the Confluent Platform encompases additional features which are developed by Confluent and not part of Apache Kafka itself.
The Confluent Platform is available as Community and Enterprise Edition. The community edition contains additional tools for development, connectivity and data compatibility. The features of the community edition are also open source. However they are published under the so called _https://www.confluent.io/confluent-community-license-faq/[Confluent Community License Agreement]_. This license is similar to the _Apache License 2.0_, but prohibits Cloud offerings which are based on them. 

.Confluent Platform Components
image::https://docs.confluent.io/5.3.2/_images/confluentPlatform.png[Confluent Platform components]

[#cp-community]
The https://docs.confluent.io/5.3.2/platform.html#community-features[community features] of the Confluent Platform are:

- https://ksqldb.io/[Confluent KSqlDB]: A streaming SQL engine for Apache Kafka, which provides an easy-to-use interactive SQL interface for stream processing on Apache Kafka, without the need to write code in a programming language such as Java. Confluent KSqlDB can be found on https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql[GitHub].
- https://docs.confluent.io/5.3.2/connect/managing/index.html#connect-managing[Confluent Connectors]: Connectors leverage the Kafka Connect API to connect Apache Kafka to other data systems. Confluent Platform provides connectors for the most popular data sources and sinks. At the https://www.confluent.io/hub/[Confluent Hub] you can find a lot of exitsing Connectors. On https://github.com/confluentinc?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=connect&type=&language=[GitHub] the source code of the community Connectors is published.
- https://docs.confluent.io/5.3.2/clients/index.html#kafka-clients[Confluent Clients]: Besides Java clients, which are part of Apache Kafka, the Confluent Platform also provides clients for https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka[C/C+\+], https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go/[Go], https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python[Python] and https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet[.Net]. However, you have to consider, that they not fully support all Kafka features (https://docs.confluent.io/5.3.2/clients/index.html#feature-support[Supported Features]).
The C/C++ client is a implementation of the Apache Kafka protocol, providing Producer, Consumer and Admin client. It is called _librdkafka_ and licensed under the _2-clause BSD license_. The other clients are built on top of _librdkafka_ and published under the _Apache License 2.0_. Besides these client libraries there are many others which just are not provided directly as part of Confluent Platform (https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka#language-bindings[Language Bindings]).
- https://docs.confluent.io/5.3.2/kafka-rest/index.html#kafkarest-intro[Confluent Rest Proxy]: Provides a RESTful interface to a Kafka cluster. It makes it easy to produce and consume messages, view the state of the cluster, and perform administrative actions without using the native Kafka protocol or clients. Confluent Rest Proxy can be found on https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-rest[GitHub].
- https://docs.confluent.io/5.3.2/schema-registry/index.html#schemaregistry-intro[Confluent Schema Registry]: Enables evolution of schemas by centralizing the management of schemas written for the Avro serialization system. It provides a RESTful interface for storing and retrieving Avro schemas. It stores a versioned history of all schemas, provides multiple compatibility settings and allows evolution of schemas according to the configured compatibility setting. Schema Registry can be found on https://github.com/confluentinc/schema-registry[GitHub]. 

[#cp-enterprise]

The enterprise edition requires a license. The availables types are described at https://docs.confluent.io/5.3.2/control-center/installation/licenses.html.

==== Download and Usage

The current version of the Confluent Platform is 5.3.2. How to manually download and install the platform is decsribed at https://docs.confluent.io/5.3.2/installation/installing_cp/zip-tar.html.

| Enterprise Edition | https://packages.confluent.io/archive/5.3/confluent-5.3.2-2.12.tar.gz
|===

Confluent Platform 5.3.2 basically includes Apache Kafka 2.3.1. However, Confluent uses a different version scheme and release cycle than Apache.
Therefore, the included Broker has the version 5.3.2 which basically is Apache Kafka 2.3.1, but may include additional bug fixes. More information about the included versions are given at the https://docs.confluent.io/5.3.2/release-notes/index.html[Confluent Platform Release Notes].

Confluence provides a detailed documentation about the platform at https://docs.confluent.io/current/.

Hint: To use Confluent Maven artifacts you have to use the Confluent Maven repository http://packages.confluent.io/maven/.

=== Confluent Cloud

Confluent Cloud is a fully managed cloud service based on Apache Kafka provided by Confluent. The Web UI is available at https://confluent.cloud/. At this page you can also create a new Account. Besides the Web UI, https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/using/cloud-basics.html#install-the-ccloud-cli[Clonfluent Cloud CLI] can be used to create and manage Kafka topics.

Confluent Cloud, in contrast to other cloud offerings like AWS Kinesis or Azure Event Hubs, is based on Apache Kafka and therfore supports all API features since Kafka 0.10.0.0 (see the https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/faq.html#what-client-and-protocol-versions-are-supported[FAQ]).
In addition, Confluent Cloud is really a fully managed service, and does not require any administrative actions to operate the cluster like AWS MSK does. 

Confluent Cloud is based on Apache Kafka, however it is not 100% identical to Apache Kafka or the Confluent Platform. The Confluent Cloud may for example miss features which are already available in the downloadable version. Which features are supported is described in the https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/release-notes.html[Confluent Cloud Release Notes]. The Confluent Cloud releases have also there own version schema. During writing, the latest version was _December 20, 2019_.
However, Confluent says that everything is based on open source components and that it is possible to recreate everything outside of Confluent Cloud (see https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/index.html#features[basic features]). For detailed information about supported features, see https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/limits.html[Confluent Cloud Supported Features and Limits].

Confluent Cloud supports the creation of Kafka clusters on GCP, AWS and Azure clouds (see https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/compare/).

The Kafka cluster created in the standard Confluent Cloud are basically virtual clusters, which are physically shared with other tenants.
For mission-critical apps, Confluent has also an enterprise offering at which a deticated Confluent Cloud environment with deticated Kafka clusters is provided. It is not possible to create an deticated Kafka Cluster via Confluent Cloud. To do this you have to get in contact with Confluent.

To get in touch with Confluent Cloud, the https://docs.confluent.io/current/quickstart/cloud-quickstart/index.html[Confluent Cloud Quick Start] is a good starting point.
In the GitHub repository https://github.com/confluentinc/examples/blob/5.3.2-post/clients/cloud/README.md[confluentinc/examples] many example implementations in multiple programming languages are provided.
In principle, the default <<apache-clients, Apache>> or <<cp-clients, Confluent client>> libraries can be used to connect to the Confluent Cloud.  
The required configuration is described in detail at the https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/using/config-client.html[Confluent Cloud client documentation].
